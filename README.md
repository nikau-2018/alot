# ALoT: Auckland Library of Tools App
A community hub that provides access to tools, reduces unnecessary consumption and empowers people to build, share & create in a sustainable way.

The Auckland Library of Tools will provide members with access to high quality and well
maintained tools and equipment. The hub will consist of a well stocked “library”, a storage
and repair space, and, ideally, an attached or associated makerspace where members can
attend workshops, learn, collaborate, meet, and share resources and ideas.
Tools will be at the heart of the library, however we use the term in the broadest sense
possible. We plan to consult with the community, and to provide resources that appeal to
and service a broad cross-section of people. Hammers and drills will sit alongside sewing
machines and cooking equipment. Need to switch out the wheels on your skateboard? Use
our socket wrench. Want to mow that berm but don’t want to buy a lawn mower? Come,
borrow ours! Or better yet, take the shovel and wheelbarrow and plant it up!

In addition, opportunities and space for workshops will be provided; community projects and
involvement will be encouraged. Whether you want to drill a hole, or learn how to use an
automated CNC router to make your own furniture, ALoT will be the place to come. ALoT will
not be “just a room full of tools”, but rather, a valued communal resource, a bustling hub, and
a generative space centered on participation, community engagement, and sustainable productivity.
